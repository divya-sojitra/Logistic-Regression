# Logistic_Regression

**Overview**<br>
This project applies Logistic Regression to classify species in the Iris dataset. The dataset is converted into a binary classification problem by removing one species. The model is optimized using GridSearchCV and evaluated using classification metrics.

**Features**<br>

**Data Loading & Preprocessing**
Uses Seabornâ€™s Iris dataset  
Converts categorical species labels to numeric values  
Splits data into training and testing sets  

**Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning**  
Uses GridSearchCV to optimize C, max_iter, and penalty  

**Model Evaluation**  
Accuracy Score  
Classification Report   

**Results**  
Best hyperparameters found using GridSearchCV  
Accuracy and classification report for performance analysis
